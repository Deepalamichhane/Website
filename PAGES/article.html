            <h1>Technology overview:</h1> 
          <p style="font-size: 18px;">In the world full of technology, watches have been going through drastic changes over the years.
            Watches which were once recognized as a timepiece now have evolved in such a way that it helps people to find their way out on 
            things. Fitness tracking, GPS, digital tracking, etc., are some features that can be seen everywhere on watches. Technology is 
            everywhere, including watches, mobile phones, and many more. Now watches have developed in such a way that they can be connected
              to their mobile phones so that they come in handy to the person using them. Technology not only has transformed how watches are
              made but also how they are designed and sold. This evolution does not stop with the watch itself, but it also influences 
              the apps, software that track data, health, and many more.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 18px;">With continuous advancements, smartwatches are now capable of monitoring sleep patterns, helping users maintain a healthy 
            lifestyle. Many watches come with waterproof features, making them suitable for athletes and swimmers. Additionally, voice 
            command integration has made interacting with smartwatches more convenient than ever before. The ability to make calls, send
            messages, and set reminders directly from a watch adds to its efficiency. Businesses and professionals also benefit from 
            smartwatch features such as calendar synchronization, email notifications, and productivity apps. Moreover, the fashion 
            industry has embraced smartwatch technology by blending stylish designs with high-tech features. Luxury watch brands have
              adapted by incorporating digital elements while maintaining classic aesthetics. Augmented reality (AR) and artificial 
              intelligence (AI) are now being integrated into smartwatches for enhanced user experience. With increasing demand, 
              smartwatch technology is expected to evolve further, making daily life even more seamless.</p>
