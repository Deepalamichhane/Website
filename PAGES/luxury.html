            <h1>Negative impacts of Technology</h1> 
            <p style="font-size: 18px;"> Technology in watches does come with some challenges, as everything has its own pros and cons. Some of the negative impacts 
              of technology include issues like battery life, which can limit the convenience of devices and include a short lifespan for
              many devices, which means they can be outdated quickly. Privacy concerns are another challenge, as data sharing can expose 
              users to potential breaches and misuse of personal information. Additionally, technologies can be hard to learn, making it 
              difficult for some people to use them. This can also lead to a loss of traditions, as newer technologies may replace older 
              ways of doing things. Unlike traditional watches that can last for years, many smartwatches need regular updates to keep them
                going. The increase in e-waste from electronics contributes to environmental problems. The high costs of new technology can
                make it difficult for some people to afford the latest devices. Maintenance can also be a problem because electronic devices
                  can require regular repair. There is also a risk of theft of high-luxury things or any valuable devices, or personal information
                  can be targeted by others.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 18px;">Furthermore, the dependence on technology in watches means they may not function properly without software support or
              internet connectivity. Many smartwatches rely on frequent firmware updates, which can introduce compatibility issues with
                older devices. The distraction caused by notifications and alerts can lead to reduced focus and productivity. Some users 
                may experience health concerns, such as eye strain or wrist discomfort, due to prolonged screen exposure and vibrations. 
                Over-reliance on technology may also reduce basic problem-solving skills, as people become accustomed to automated solutions.
                Cybersecurity threats, such as hacking and malware, pose additional risks to user data and device functionality.</p>
